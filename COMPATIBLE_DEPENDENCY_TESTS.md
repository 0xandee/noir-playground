```

**Code:**
```noir
use dep::noir_base64;

pub fn main(input: pub str<10>) -> pub [u8; 16] {
    // Encode a string to base64
    noir_base64::BASE64_ENCODER::encode(input.as_bytes())
}
```

Execution failed: Dependency resolution failed: Failed to fetch file tree for noir-lang/noir-bignum@v999.999.999: GitHub API error: 404 Not Found
```

**Expected Results:**
- ❌ Clear error indicating tag doesn't exist
- ✅ No hanging or timeout issues
- ✅ Graceful error handling

**Success Criteria:**
- Error message mentions the invalid tag
- Quick failure (<2 seconds)
- Clear guidance to user

---

## Test 7: Error Handling - Malformed Git URL

**Objective:** Verify error handling for invalid GitHub URLs

**Configuration:**
```toml
[dependencies]
bignum = { tag = "v0.8.0", git = "not-a-valid-url-at-all" }
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Compiling circuit with Noir WASM...
Resolving dependencies...
Found 1 git dependency
Fetching bignum from not-a-valid-url-at-all@v0.8.0...
Execution failed: Dependency resolution failed: Invalid GitHub URL: not-a-valid-url-at-all
```

**Expected Results:**

- No network requests attempted

---

## Test 8: Error Handling - Missing Tag Field

**Objective:** Verify behavior when required tag is omitted

**Configuration:**
```toml
[dependencies]
bignum = { git = "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-bignum" }
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Compiling circuit with Noir WASM...
Resolving dependencies...
Found 0 git dependencies
All dependencies resolved. Compiling...
Execution failed: Compilation failed: Could not resolve 'bignum' in path /noir_project/src/main.nr:1: bignum
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Dependency skipped during parsing (no tag = not valid)
- Compilation fails when trying to import
- This is expected behavior (tag required for version pinning)

**Success Criteria:**
- System doesn't crash
- Clear compilation error
- Dependency correctly ignored during parsing

---

## Test 9: Caching Behavior Validation

**Objective:** Verify FileManager caching works correctly across compilations

**Steps:**
1. Run Test 2 (bignum example) successfully
2. **WITHOUT refreshing the page**, modify only the Noir code:
```noir
use dep::bignum;

pub fn main(x: Field, y: pub Field) -> pub Field {
    // Changed from addition to multiplication
    x * y
}
```
3. Set inputs: `x = "10"`, `y = "20"`
4. Click "Compile & Run" again
5. Observe console output

**Expected Console Output (Second Run):**
```
Compiling circuit with Noir WASM...
Resolving dependencies...
Found 1 git dependency
Fetching bignum from https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-bignum@v0.8.0...
Downloading 51 files for bignum...
✓ bignum installed
Resolving 1 dependency of bignum...
Fetching poseidon from https://github.com/noir-lang/poseidon@v0.1.1...
Downloading 9 files for poseidon...
✓ poseidon installed
All 2 dependencies resolved
All dependencies resolved. Compiling...
Compilation successful (XXXms) - 2 dependencies resolved
```

**Expected Results:**
- ⚠️ Dependencies ARE re-fetched (current behavior)
- ✅ Resolution completes successfully
- ✅ Compilation uses cached files from FileManager
- ✅ Full pipeline succeeds
- ✅ Output: 200

**Notes:**
- FileManager cache persists within session but resolution always runs
- Refreshing page clears FileManager cache
- This is expected behavior (resolution is idempotent)

---

## Test 10: Performance Validation - Large Dependency Graph

**Objective:** Validate performance with maximum compatible dependencies

**Configuration:**
```toml
[package]
name = "playground"

noir_base64 = { tag = "v0.4.2", git = "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir_base64" }
poseidon = { tag = "v0.1.1", git = "https://github.com/noir-lang/poseidon" }
```

**Code:**
```noir
use dep::bignum;
use dep::noir_base64;
use dep::poseidon;

pub fn main(x: Field, y: pub Field) -> pub Field {
    // All three libraries available
    x + y
}
```

**Inputs:**
- `x = "100"`
- `y = "200"`

## Known Limitations

### Library Ecosystem Maturity
- **Issue:** Very few Noir libraries have been updated for v1.0.0
- **Available Libraries:** Only 3 confirmed compatible (bignum, noir_base64, poseidon)
- **Impact:** Limited test scenario variety

### No Version Conflict Resolution
- **Issue:** System uses first-encountered version (Set-based name deduplication)
- **Example:** If lib A needs poseidon v0.1.1 and lib B needs poseidon v0.2.0, first wins
- **Note:** Not an issue with current compatible libraries (no conflicts exist)

### Test Coverage
- Cannot test deep dependency chains (>2 levels) with compatible libraries
- Cannot test diamond dependencies with compatible libraries
- Cannot test large graphs (>3 dependencies total) with compatible libraries
